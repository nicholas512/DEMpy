DEMpy
=====

DEMPY makes it easy to download and mosaic DEM tiles from multiple providers based on areal extents or coordinates


Installation
============

To install DEMpy, just navigate to your 

.. code-block:: bash

    cd dempy
    python setup.py

There are certain requirements that can be difficult to get on windows. For GDAL, I recommend using the terrific resources on `<http://www.gisinternals.com/archive.php>`_ and  `<https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_
